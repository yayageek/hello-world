# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Hello,

I'm Jingya Zou. I like fashion stuff a lot. Someday I want to be an editor for a famous fashion magazine or an apparel designer even though my background is more mathematics and supply chain related. If neither of them are too unrealistic to be achieved, I can at least be a fashion blogger on Instagram or Youtube.
